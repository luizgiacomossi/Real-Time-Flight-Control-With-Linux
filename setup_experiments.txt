For a quadcopter flight control system, using SCHED_DEADLINE is well-suited for deterministic timing of control loops. The parameters depend on the control frequency, CPU budget, and deadline requirements of your flight control software.

Assumptions

Let’s say the flight control loop runs at 500 Hz (i.e., every 2 ms):

    Period (P) = 2 ms = 2,000,000 ns

    Deadline (D) = 2 ms = 2,000,000 ns (typical to match period)

    Runtime (R) = 400 µs = 400,000 ns (based on control loop WCET estimate)

attr.sched_runtime  = 400000;    // 400 µs
attr.sched_deadline = 2000000;   // 2 ms
attr.sched_period   = 2000000;   // 2 ms

This gives the task a 20% CPU budget (400 µs every 2 ms), which leaves headroom for other tasks and helps prevent overload.

Guidelines for Choosing Parameters
1. Measure Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET)

Use tools like ftrace, perf, or cyclictest to benchmark your flight controller loop.
2. Leave Slack in Deadline

If WCET is 400 µs, set the deadline to 600–800 µs to account for spikes and I/O jitter.
3. Don’t Exceed CPU Capacity

Sum of all runtime/period fractions across all SCHED_DEADLINE tasks must not exceed 100% per CPU.
4. Avoid Setting Deadline < Runtime

Will result in EINVAL or unpredictable behavior.

Suggested Configs by Control Loop Frequency
| Loop Rate | Period (ns) | Runtime (ns) | Deadline (ns) | Budget % |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| 1000 Hz   | 1,000,000   | 200,000      | 1,000,000     | 20%      |
| 500 Hz    | 2,000,000   | 400,000      | 2,000,000     | 20%      |
| 250 Hz    | 4,000,000   | 800,000      | 4,000,000     | 20%      |
| 100 Hz    | 10,000,000  | 1,000,000    | 10,000,000    | 10%      |

light-Critical Considerations

    Pin tasks to isolated CPUs with isolcpus/cpuset.

    Disable CPU frequency scaling and Turbo Boost to reduce jitter.

    Use CPU affinity to prevent migration between cores.

    Avoid memory pressure, disable swap, lock memory (mlockall).

To configure stress-ng to simulate real-world load for a drone control system, you must first consider which subsystems the drone's control software stresses most during operation. Typical loads include:

    CPU computation (for real-time decision-making, control loops)

    Memory usage (path planning, map storage): For map handling, sensor fusion, or large buffers:

    I/O and IPC (sensor input, communication between modules): Drone systems often use shared memory or sockets: Simulates inter-process communication with pipes, message queues, and sockets.

    Thread/process scheduling (real-time task execution):Exercises the scheduler to simulate real-time thread contention.

Run CPU, memory, and I/O stressors simultaneously:
stress-ng --cpu 4 --vm 2 --hdd 1 --timeout 120s

This combo hits CPU, memory, disk, and communication subsystems for a full-system stress profile.
stress-ng \
  --cpu 4 --cpu-method matrixprod \
  --vm 2 --vm-bytes 75% --vm-method all --verify\
  --hdd 1 --hdd-bytes 1G \
  --pipe 4 --mq 2 --sock 2 \
  --sched 2 \
  --timeout 300s

--cpu-method matrixprod mimics linear algebra-heavy workloads common in drone path planning or control systems.


IMU for the Crazyflie:

    Raw IMU sensor (BMI088) sampling: Up to 4 kHz.
    Internal flight controller processing and PID loop: 2 kHz.
    Data streaming over radio (e.g., to a PC): Limited to 100 Hz.
    
Key Takeaways for this Setup:

400kHz Fast Mode I²C or up to 20MHz SPI (MPU-6000 only) serial host interfaces
    Control Loop (500 Hz / 2 ms): This is a respectable frequency for a
     drone control loop, offering good responsiveness.
    IMU Sampling (1000 Hz / 1 ms): You will be acquiring new IMU data twice as fast as your control loop runs. This gives you options:
        You can simply use the latest IMU reading available at the start of your 500 Hz control loop.
        You can, and often should, average the two (or more, if sampling higher) IMU readings received within each 2 ms control loop period. This acts as a low-pass filter, reducing high-frequency noise from the IMU.
    Synchronization: It's important that your code ensures the IMU data acquisition is synchronized with or slightly ahead of your control loop's execution. You need to make sure that a fresh IMU reading is ready when your 500 Hz control loop starts its calculations.

    ✅ Updated latency breakdown at 24 MHz

Assuming an IMU read of 14 bytes (typical for 6-axis + timestamp):
| Stage                        | Approx. Latency  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `ioctl()` setup              | \~30–80 µs       |
| Context switch (user→kernel) | \~20–50 µs       |
| **SPI transfer @24 MHz**     | **\~4.7 µs**     |
| Context switch (kernel→user) | \~20–50 µs       |
| **Total round-trip**         | **\~100–250 µs** |

Even doubling the SPI speed from 10 MHz to 24 MHz only saves a few microseconds per transaction unless you're transferring large blocks.

This includes:

    System call overhead (e.g., ioctl)

    Context switching (user ↔ kernel)

    SPI bus transfer time (depends on frequency and message size)

    Optional: GPIO toggle time (if using manual CS)
